# TokoBeDia-Project
Tokobedia is a project that i made with my 3 other friends for Program Design Method (PSD) subject or sometimes known as Domain Driven Design (DDD) subject. 
We made this project with Visual Studio 2015 using .NET Framework and SAP Crystal Report for making reports. 
This Project is about online store, with 3 roles of people in it; Admin can insert, delete, update product; Guests can only see random product list in the homepage; Users not only can see the list but also put items to cart, do transaction and payment and get the reports or bills.
